        "strInstructions": "In a medium bowl mix egg yolks, philly cheese and baking powder using a hand held mixer. Carefully start adding the flour. When the mixture will not be mixing well, and will look like wood chips, put away the blending mixer and using your hands knead the dough.\r\nCreate a roll and cover in foil and freeze for 15 minutes. At this time preheat the oven to 375.\r\nTake the dough out and separate into two. Roll and cut out 3 inch trangles.\r\nMake as many as you can and on centre of each put a small spoon of jam. Roll them into a croissant shape.\r\nPlace the croissants onto a greased cookie sheet, and bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden.\r\nRepeat with the rest of the dough.\r\nWhen you take them out, put aside and sprinkle with powdered sugar on top.\r\nThis makes about 3 batches of 20 cookies each.\r\nTotal count about 60 cookies.",
